# invPLOT
Set of custom R scripts for visualizing (using ggplot2) genomic inversions.

## Description
Set of custom R scripts that takes a tab-delimited bed-file (including header) with the following fields specified: `chr---start---end---size`
and outputs a set number of figures that visualizes genomic inversions annotated in bed file. Package was developed to standardize inversion plotting, but scripts will execute on any type of structural variation (SV) pressent ininput bed-file. 

## Examples
All example figures were generated by implementing designed funtions on test-data (included) drawn from 49 Strand-seq libraries (reference sample HG0002).

### Inversion size distribution density (`SV.size.dens.R`)
